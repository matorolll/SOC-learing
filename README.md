August marked the beginning of my adventure with the TryHackMe platform and the continuation of my education after graduating from college. In that first month, I completed 63% of the SOC lvl1 path, and since creating my account, I have reached the top 6% of users, completing 52 rooms and finishing almost 1,200 individual tasks. My current streak is 31, which means I haven't missed a single day of learning. During the first month, I learned the basics of SOC analyst work, including CKC, Diamond model, and MITRE. I learned the Yara language and tools such as OpenCTI and MISP. For network security: Snort, Zeek, Brim, NetworkMiner, Wireshark, TShark. For endpoint monitoring:  Sysinternal, Sysmon, Osquery, Wazuh. For SIEM tools: Kibana, ELK, and Splunk. During August, I also started actively looking for a job in the profession. I had three job interviews, each of which was positive with the possibility of immediate employment. At the end of the month, I decided to take a job as a network administrator. The next month of learning will be a little slower due to taking this job.

September was a continuation of my learning on the TryHackMe platform. This month, I completed 98% of the SOC Level 1 course, leaving only the preparations for certification for a quieter period. During this month, I also completed the Pre Security path to refresh my knowledge of the basics of the job. After work, I usually carefully completed one or two rooms from the Cyber Security 101 path. I finished the month in the top 3% of users on the site, with 100 rooms completed and 2,300 tasks completed. My current streak is already 61 days, and I don't intend to stop there. While learning this month, I discovered many useful tools, including Redline, TheHive, Tcpdump, and many more. I also completed my first serious CTF in preparation for certification. In my first month on the job, I had the opportunity to apply my newly learned technologies to solve real-world problems in a live environment.

October was another productive month. This month, I completed the SOC L1 course, which was the most important one for me. Then, I continued my previous courses and developed my red team skills in order to improve my abilities in this field as well.  On the tryhackme platform, I achieved a global user ranking of 27,000, which places me in the top 2% of users on the site. I have already completed 135 rooms and over 3,000 tasks since the beginning of my adventure. I currently have a streak of 93, which I hope will exceed three digits. This month, I also started many private projects, which resulted in fewer completed tasks.
