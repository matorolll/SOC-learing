August marked the beginning of my adventure with the TryHackMe platform and the continuation of my education after graduating from college. In that first month, I completed 63% of the SOC lvl1 path, and since creating my account, I have reached the top 6% of users, completing 52 rooms and finishing almost 1,200 individual tasks. My current streak is 31, which means I haven't missed a single day of learning. During the first month, I learned the basics of SOC analyst work, including CKC, Diamond model, and MITRE. I learned the Yara language and tools such as OpenCTI and MISP. For network security: Snort, Zeek, Brim, NetworkMiner, Wireshark, TShark. For endpoint monitoring:  Sysinternal, Sysmon, Osquery, Wazuh. For SIEM tools: Kibana, ELK, and Splunk. During August, I also started actively looking for a job in the profession. I had three job interviews, each of which was positive with the possibility of immediate employment. At the end of the month, I decided to take a job as a network administrator. The next month of learning will be a little slower due to taking this job.
